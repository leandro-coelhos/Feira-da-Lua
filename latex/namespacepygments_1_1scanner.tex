\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}    pygments.scanner
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This library implements a regex based scanner. Some languages
    like Pascal are easy to parse but have some keywords that
    depend on the context. Because of this it's impossible to lex
    that just by using a regular expression lexer like the
    `RegexLexer`.

    Have a look at the `DelphiLexer` to get an idea of how to use
    this scanner.
